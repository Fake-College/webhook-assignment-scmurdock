# Lab

**You will use the putting_python_to_work.py file to write your code**

In this lab, you will ask the user for the radius of a circle. You will then calculate the diameter, circumference, and area of that circle. Those values will then be printed out for the user.

The formulas you will need for this lab are the following:

- \( d = 2 \times r \): Diameter is twice the radius.
- \( c = 2 \times \pi \times r \): Circumference is two times Pi (\( \pi \approx 3.14 \)) times the radius.
- \( \text{Area} = \pi \times r^2 \): Area is Pi times the radius squared.

The key to writing good computer programs (i.e., code) is to plan out the process (i.e., algorithm) first, using pseudo-code and/or a flowchart. Before you write one line of Python code for this lab, plan it out using a flowchart.

Once you do write code, add comments to each line to indicate what is being accomplished in that line.

Click the terminal in the codespace and type `pytest` to test your code.
